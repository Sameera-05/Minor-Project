# Computer Vision Implementation 
Computer vision (CV) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to 
derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs. One of the applications of CV 
is studying the movements and gestures of hands. Hand gestures offer an inspiring field of research because 
they can facilitate communication and provide a natural means of interaction that can be used across a variety 
of applications. In this project, a virtual calculator is developed using OpenCV and the Mediapipe library. Virtual 
calculator performs the arithmetic operations by detecting hand movements and hand gestures using a webcam. 
In addition to this, a user interface was developed to show the results of virtual calculator.
